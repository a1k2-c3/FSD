	<p> Blended from the finest high grown Arabicas, that India has to offer, this cup is simply love at first sip. A lush body with a buttery mouth feel and an aroma of mild fruity notes makes this blend very special. This blend has medium acidity with a finish of chocolate to it. </p>

	<p> This is a very strong type of coffee, which is made by forcing hot water through tightly packed ground coffee. Espresso uses high pressure to push more water through than a drip machine could, resulting in a concentrated liquid with a very intense flavor. 

The fancy name for espresso is ristretto. Espresso is typically served in 1-ounce servings. These double-walled cups are perfect for espresso.

You don't need an expensive machine to make espresso. Almost any pod-based espresso maker can create rich espresso right at home. It's easier and cheaper than making your cup of French press. </p>
